# hemalScraper
BeautifulSoup based Webscraper for Python

Currently in development, so this repository should look a little messy.

main.py : driver that runs the file scraper.py (which is the source code for the final package).
scraper.py : source code for package functions
setup.py  : setup file for the final package, currently should not be used
webscraper.py : standalone file initially meant to be used as a webscraper, scrapped for the package approach (non-functional due to the US CDC updating their website)
